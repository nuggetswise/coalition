        The recommendation is generated by the AI based on:
        - The incident description you provided
        - The underwriting checklist items you selected (which reflect key risk controls and exposures)
        - The broker's Yes/No answers to clarifying questions (which indicate the presence or absence of critical controls)
        - The AI weighs the risk impact, control gaps, and business context to suggest the most appropriate underwriting action (Accept, Request Fix, Decline),
        - The confidence score reflects the AI's certainty based on the completeness and quality of the information provided.
        - The risk mitigation suggestions and remediation steps are tailored to the specific scenario and broker responses, ensuring actionable and relevant guidance for both underwriters and brokers.
